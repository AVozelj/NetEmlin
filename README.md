This is a sample blog, compatible with Netlify CMS.

Hit this one button:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/getnikola/nikola-netlify-cms&scheme=cms)

You should end up with a site with the Netlify CMS available in `/admin/`. (Extra configuration, eg. a better domain name, may be required)
